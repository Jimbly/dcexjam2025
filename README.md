Dungeon Crawler Limited Asset Jam 2025 Entry by Jimbly - "Title TBD"

**TODO**
* OMP AI ticking
  * plan: clients run steps; do it scheduled/delayed as well as pre-emptively before a move
  * next:
    * enemies attack
    * battlezone system
  * deal with race conditions:
    * battlezone leader leaves/changes
    * non-ready person leaves
    * ready person leaves
* aiHunter should follow a player through a door (or: if they arrive at last know spot, should enter a random door? or doors are open vis for hunter?)

Assets to replace
* scroll bar
* buttons / menu
* panel / status message background
* chat send/receive/join/leave sounds

TODO
* bug: visibility is different before/after turning camera/moving forward and back
  * relatedly: always show monster behind (and diagonals?)
* Deal with more than 4 players in battlezone list (scrollbar, dither, hide?)
* click to move - ensure stop when enter (active?) battlezone
* click to move - stop when threatened (or, always in battlezone?)
